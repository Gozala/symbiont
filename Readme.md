# Symbiont

This is a browser experiment that attempts to work in symbiosis with your work flow. This experiment removes tabs from the UI and attempts to think of them as an active history, there for symbiont manages tabs for you, kills them when it would benefit performance, and brings them back to life on demand.

This experiment is at very early stage so there is not much there to see.

## Hack

If you'd like to hack on this project, easiest path to get started is by clonning repo and installing dependencies via `npm install`. You can run your code via `npm start` command (if you're on mac, otherwise check the start script in `package.json`). You can run app with debugger via `npm run debug` command and connect to the application via [WebIDE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/WebIDE) on a port `6000`.
